**About**

The Getting Started Demo by Speedgoat, takes you through the typical real-time simulation and testing workflows using simple exercises that include Simulink models and Speedgoat real-time target machines with I/O connected to a Device Under Test (DUT) with an electric DC motor, switches, and LEDs. 

The reference application leverages the Speedgoat [Getting Started Demo Kit](https://www.speedgoat.com/products-services/demo-kits/getting-started-demo), which features an electric servo DC motor via a H-bridge and a potentiometer feedback.

This kit seamless operates with the cost-effective [IO397 FGPA I/O Module](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/simulink-programmable-fpgas-fpga-i-o-modules-io397) and is delivered with a custom FPGA implementation file integrating [PWM generation](https://www.speedgoat.com/products/simulink-programmable-fpgas-fpga-code-module-pwm-generation), [I2C communication](https://www.speedgoat.com/products-services/communications-protocols/i2c), and General Purpose Digital I/O code modules.

**Learn how to:**

 - Integrate analog and digital I/O driver blocks to your model
 - Create a real-time application from Simulink, and download it to a Speedgoat real-time target machine
 - Connect the Real-time target machine to a simple device under test (DUT) including an electric DC motor, LEDs, and switches
 - Implment PWM and I2C communication on configurable FPGA
 - Monitor, log, and tune signal parameters on the fly
